# My Notes

A personal knowledge base of concepts, explanations, and written notes collected while learning and building things.

This repo is **text-first**. No runnable code, no experiments. Just ideas, breakdowns, and things worth remembering.

If it compiles or runs, it probably lives somewhere else.

## What this repo is

* Markdown-based notes
* Explanations of concepts I don’t want to forget
* References I keep coming back to
* Cleaned-up thoughts after reading, watching, or building something

This is the **theory side** of my workflow.

## What this repo is not

* Not a library
* Not production code
* Not optimized for teaching others
* Not guaranteed to be complete or beginner-friendly

Notes exist to be useful, not perfect.

## Structure

The structure evolves as topics grow. Files are grouped by subject and expanded over time.

Expect:

* Concept-focused markdown files
* Simple explanations
* Occasional diagrams or examples
* Zero concern for aesthetics over clarity

## Related repo

* **My-Dev-Notes**
  The code counterpart to this repo. Algorithms, implementations, and experiments live there.

Together:

* **My-Notes** → understanding
* **My-Dev-Notes** → execution (sometimes)
