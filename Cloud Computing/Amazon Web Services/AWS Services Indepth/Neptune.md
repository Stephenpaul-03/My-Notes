## **Definition**

- Amazon Neptune is a fully managed graph database service designed for applications that require highly connected data and complex relationships. 
- It supports both property graph and RDF graph models, making it ideal for social networks, fraud detection, and recommendation engines.

## **Graph Database Models**

- **Property Graph Model (Gremlin & openCypher)** – Uses nodes, edges, and properties to represent relationships.
- **RDF (Resource Description Framework) Model (SPARQL)** – Uses triples (subject-predicate-object) for semantic web applications.

## **High Performance & Scalability**

- **Optimized for Graph Queries** – Handles millions of relationships with **low-latency queries**.
- **Read Replicas** – Supports up to **15 read replicas** for load balancing and high availability.
- **Horizontal & Vertical Scaling** – Automatically scales based on workload needs.

## **Security & Compliance**

- **Encryption with AWS KMS** – Secures data at rest and in transit.
- **IAM Authentication & VPC Isolation** – Provides secure access and fine-grained permissions.
- **Automated Backups & Multi-AZ Deployment** – Ensures high availability and disaster recovery.

## **Graph Query Languages**

- **Gremlin** (Apache TinkerPop) – Used for property graph queries.
- **SPARQL** (W3C Standard) – Used for semantic web and knowledge graphs.
- **openCypher** – SQL-like query language for graph databases.
