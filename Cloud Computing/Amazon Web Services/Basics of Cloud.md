## Characteristics

1. On Demand Self Service
    - Provision and use resources without interaction from the CSP.
2. Broad Network Access
    - Available over the network.
3. Multi-Tenancy and Resource polling
    - Multiple Customers Share the same infrastructure and resources.
4. Rapid Elasticity And Scalability
    - Automatically Acquire and Dispose of resources when Needed.
5. Measured Service
    - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

## Advantages

1. OPEX (Operation Expenses) over CAPEX (Capital Expenses)
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes

## Problems Solved

1. Flexibility 
2. Cost-Effectiveness
3. Scalability
4. Elasticity
5. High Availability and Fault Tolerance
6. Agility

## Deployments Models

### Private Cloud

- Used by a Single Organization
- Not Exposed to the Public
- Complete Control
- Secure for Sensitive Application
- Example - RackSpace

### Public Cloud

- Used by Public
- Owned and Operated by 3rd Party CSP

### Hybrid Cloud

- Semi-Private/Semi-Public
- Control Sensitive Data in Private Servers and Use Public Servers for Flexibility and Effectiveness

## Types of Cloud Computing

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

- **What it provides**:
    - Provides virtualized computing resources
    - Includes virtual machines, storage, networking, and other basic infrastructure components.
- **User control**:
    - Control over the operating systems, storage, and deployed applications
    - but not over the hardware.
- **Best for**:
    - who need full control over the infrastructure
    - To manage and configure the hardware, operating systems, and software.
- **Examples:**
    - Amazon EC2

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

- **What it provides**:
    - Offers a platform that includes infrastructure as well as development tools, databases, and runtime environments to develop, test, and deploy applications
    - No need to manage the underlying hardware.
- **User control**:
    - Develop and deploy their applications
    - Do not manage the underlying infrastructure or operating system.
- **Best for**:
    - Who want to focus on coding and deploying applications without worrying about the underlying hardware or operating system.
- **Example:**
    - Elastic Beanstalk

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

- **What it provides**:
    - Provides fully managed applications over the internet.
    - These are ready-to-use software solutions that can be accessed via a browser.
- **User control**:
    - Interact with the software interface
    - Do not have control over the underlying platform or infrastructure.
- **Best for**:
    - Who need access to fully functional software applications without any need to manage infrastructure or development.
- **Example:**
    - Rekognition
