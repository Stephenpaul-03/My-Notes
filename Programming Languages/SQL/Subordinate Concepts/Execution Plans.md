## Definition

- An execution plan outlines the sequence of operations the DBMS will take to retrieve or modify data as specified by your SQL query
- The plan is generated by the query optimizer, which analyzes various possible strategies and selects the most efficient one based on cost estimation (CPU, memory, and disk usage)
## Types

| Type           | Description                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Estimated Plan | Predicted steps by the optimizer before query execution, based on statistics and schema.                   |
| Actual Plan    | Shows the steps actually taken during execution, including runtime information and resource usage metrics. |
- **Estimated plans** help identify potential issues before executing the query.
- **Actual plans** are valuable for understanding real-world performance and resource consumption
## Reasons

- **Performance Optimization:**
    - Execution plans reveal slow operations or bottlenecks, such as missing indexes or costly joins, allowing you to tune queries for efficiency.
- **Troubleshooting:**
    - By analyzing the plan, causes can be pinpointed of slow queries or excessive resource usage.
- **Indexing:**
    - Help determine where to add, modify, or remove indexes to speed up data retrieval.
- **Cost Estimation:**
    - Plans indicate which operations are the most expensive, guiding your optimization efforts.

## Components

- **Operators:**
    - Each operation (e.g., table scan, join, sort, index seek) is represented by an operator in the plan.
- **Nodes/Steps:**
    - In graphical plans, each node symbolizes an operation. Nodes are connected by arrows that represent data flow and volume.
- **Data Flow Arrows:**
    - The arrowsâ€™ thickness indicates the amount of data moving between operations.
- **Cost Estimates:**
    - Plans include percentage costs for each operation, helping you focus on the most resource-intensive steps.

## Reading an Execution Plan

- View the plan from **right to left**:
    - Start at the rightmost operator, which typically reads the source tables, and move left toward the final SELECT operator.
- Analyze each node for:
    - Type of operation (scan vs. seek, join types)
    - Number of rows processed (estimated vs. actual)
    - Relative cost of each operation
    - Data flow between steps
- Identify costly or inefficient operations to target for optimization.
