## Relational Database

- **Structure:**
    - Use a predefined schema and store data in tables with rows and columns.
- **Data Integrity:**
    - Rely on **ACID** properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure reliable transactions and strong consistency.
- **Query Language:**
    - Standardized query language (SQL) for complex queries, joins, and aggregations.
- **Examples:**
    - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Financial systems, ERP, CRM, and applications needing complex queries and rigorous data consistency.

## Non-Relational Databases

- **Structure:**
    - Use a flexible, often schema-less design. Data can be organized as key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graphs.
- **Data Integrity:**
    - Typically use the **BASE** model (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent), favoring availability and scalability over strict consistency.
- **Query Language:**
    - Varies by database type; may use custom query languages (e.g., MongoDB queries, Cassandra Query Language).
- **Examples:**
    - MongoDB (document), Cassandra (wide-column), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).
- **Use Cases:**
    - Content management, IoT data, analytics platforms, web/mobile applications with unstructured or evolving data.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Relational (SQL) | Non-Relational (NoSQL) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Model | Fixed schema: tables, rows, columns | Flexible schema: documents, key-value, etc. |
| Consistency Model | Strong consistency (ACID) | Eventual consistency (BASE) |
| Query Language | SQL (Structured Query Language) | Varies (custom APIs, NoSQL query languages) |
| Scaling | Vertical (bigger servers) | Horizontal (add more servers/nodes) |
| Flexibility | Rigid; changes require schema migrations | Highly flexible; accepts varying data models |
| Relationships | Strong support for joins and relationships | Limited; often handles denormalized data |
| Performance | Optimized for complex queries and transactions | Optimized for high throughput and scalability |
| Typical Use Cases | Financial, operational, legacy enterprise systems | Big data, real-time analytics, scalable apps |

## When to Use Each

- **Use a Relational Database when:**
    - Data is highly structured and transactional integrity is critical.
    - You need complex queries, reporting, or strong referential integrity.
    - Schema changes are rare and carefully managed.
- **Use a Non-Relational Database when:**
    - You require fast, scalable performance with flexible or unstructured data.
    - The application demands distribution across many nodes or geographies.
    - The data model evolves frequently, or each record may differ in structure.
