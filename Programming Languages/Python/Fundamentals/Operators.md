## **# 1. Arithmetic Operators**

Perform mathematical calculations.

| Operator | Operation | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | 5 + 3 = 8 |
| - | Subtraction | 5 - 3 = 2 |
| * | Multiplication | 5 * 3 = 15 |
| / | Division | 5 / 3 = 1.66 |
| // | Floor Division | 5 // 3 = 1 |
| % | Modulus (remainder) | 5%% 3 = 2 |
| ** | Exponentiation | 2 ** 3 = 8 |

## **# 2. Assignment Operators**

Assign values or modify and assign combined operations.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| = | Assign | x = 5 |
| += | Add and assign | x += 3 (x = x + 3) |
| -= | Subtract and assign | x -= 3 |
| *= | Multiply and assign | x *= 3 |
| /= | Divide and assign | x /= 3 |
| %= | Modulus and assign | x %= 3 |
| //= | Floor divide and assign | x //= 3 |
| **= | Power and assign | x **= 3 |
| &= | Bitwise AND and assign | x &= 3 |
|  | = | Bitwise OR and assign |
| ^= | Bitwise XOR and assign | x ^= 3 |
| >>= | Right shift and assign | x >>= 3 |
| <<= | Left shift and assign | x <<= 3 |

## **# 3. Comparison Operators**

Compare two values and return a Boolean.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Equal | x == y |
| != | Not equal | x != y |
| > | Greater than | x > y |
| < | Less than | x < y |
| >= | Greater than or equal | x >= y |
| <= | Less than or equal | x <= y |

## **# 4. Logical Operators**

Combine Boolean expressions.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| and | Logical AND | (x > 3) and (y < 5) |
| or | Logical OR | (x > 3) or (y < 5) |
| not | Logical NOT | not(x > 3) |

## **# 5. Bitwise Operators**

Operate on bits of integers.

| Operator | Meaning     | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| &        | Bitwise AND | x & y   |
| \|       | Bitwise OR  | x \| y  |
| ^        | Bitwise XOR | x ^ y   |
| ~        | Bitwise NOT | ~x      |
| <<       | Left shift  | x << 2  |
| >>       | Right shift | x >> 2  |

## **# 6. Identity Operators**

Check if two variables refer to same object in memory.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| is | True if same object | x is y |
| is not | True if different objects | x is not y |

## **# 7. Membership Operators**

Check membership in sequences like list, tuple, string.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| in | True if value found in sequence | x in y |
| not in | True if value not found | x not in y |
