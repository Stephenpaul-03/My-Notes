## **Definition**

- Pipelining refers to **executing multiple operations simultaneously**, where the **output of one operator serves as the input of the next**, without waiting for the previous operation to fully complete.

**Instead of this (Materialization):**

```

Step 1: Read → Write to Disk →  
Step 2: Read from Disk → Next Step

```

**It does this (Pipelining):**

```

Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 (All stream results simultaneously)

```

## **Components**

### **Parsing & Optimization**

- SQL query is parsed and converted into an internal representation (logical tree).
- The query optimizer generates an **execution plan** using cost-based or heuristic approaches.

### **Execution**

- The plan is interpreted or compiled.
- Execution operators (joins, filters, projections, etc.) are arranged in a **pipelined topology**.

### **Result Generation**

- Results stream out row-by-row as soon as they’re computed.
- Output is returned to the client or further processed (e.g., sorted, aggregated).

## **Working**

Pipelining uses **iterator-based execution**, where each operator implements an interface like:

```

Open() → GetNext() → Close()

```

- `GetNext()` is called repeatedly to fetch one tuple at a time.
- Operators don’t wait for full input; they request input rows on-demand.
- E.g., a **SELECT → JOIN → PROJECT** pipeline processes rows incrementally.

## **Advantages**

| Benefit | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **Reduced Latency** | Users see partial results sooner; useful in interactive applications. |
| **Lower I/O Overhead** | Avoids writing intermediate results to disk. |
| **Parallelism** | Stages can execute concurrently, improving CPU utilization. |
| **Memory Efficiency** | Operators hold only a few rows at a time. |
| **Better Throughput** | Especially in OLAP workloads or large data scans. |

## **Challenges**

| Challenge | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Pipeline Stall** | If a downstream operator is slow (e.g., sort), it causes upstream blocking. |
| **Blocking Operators** | Some operations (e.g., sort, aggregate without grouping) require full input—**break pipeline**. |
| **Skewed Data** | Uneven distribution can cause load imbalance among operators. |
| **Complex Coordination** | Efficient pipelining requires intelligent scheduling and resource management. |

## **Blocking vs. Non-blocking Operators**

| Operator Type | Examples | Pipeline Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Non-blocking** | Filter, Project, Nested Loop Join | Allow pipelining |
| **Blocking** | Sort, Aggregate (without group-by), Hash Join Build Phase | Interrupt pipeline, require materialization |

## **Pipeline vs Materialization**

| Aspect | Pipelining | Materialization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Performance | Faster due to concurrency | Slower due to intermediate storage |
| Memory | Low usage | May require disk I/O |
| Flexibility | Limited (some ops block pipeline) | Full flexibility with all operators |
| Fault Isolation | Harder (errors propagate upstream) | Easier recovery |
