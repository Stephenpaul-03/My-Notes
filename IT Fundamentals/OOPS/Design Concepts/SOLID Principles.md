## **Definition**

- SOLID is a set of five design principles to write scalable, maintainable, and robust OOP systems. Coined by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).

| Principle | Description | Core Idea |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S** – Single Responsibility Principle | A class should have **only one reason to change**. | Do one thing well. |
| **O** – Open/Closed Principle | Software entities should be **open for extension but closed for modification**. | Use abstraction to extend behavior. |
| **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle | Subtypes must be **substitutable** for their base types without altering correctness. | Don’t break polymorphism. |
| **I** – Interface Segregation Principle | Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they **don’t use**. | Prefer multiple small interfaces. |
| **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle | Depend on **abstractions, not concrete implementations**. | Invert the control of dependencies. |
