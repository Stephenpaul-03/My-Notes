## **Definition**
 
 - Design Patterns are proven, reusable solutions to common software design problems.

| Category | Examples | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Creational** | Factory, Singleton, Builder | Manage object creation logic. |
| **Structural** | Adapter, Composite, Proxy | Organize classes/objects for better structure. |
| **Behavioral** | Strategy, Observer, Command | Define how objects communicate. |

## **Notable Patterns:**

- **Factory**: Create objects without specifying exact class.
- **Singleton**: Ensure a class has only one instance (e.g., DB Connection).
- **Observer**: Notify multiple objects on state change (e.g., UI updates).
- **Strategy**: Select an algorithm at runtime (e.g., payment processors).
- **Decorator**: Add responsibilities without subclassing.
