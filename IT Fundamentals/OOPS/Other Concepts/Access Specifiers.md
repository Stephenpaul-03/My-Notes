| `protected`          | Package + subclass (see note) | Subclass + current assembly       | Prefix `_`, weakly enforced (convention)    | Same class, subclasses (`protected`), or same package (Java) |
| `default`/`internal` | Only within package           | Within same assembly (`internal`) | No direct equivalent                        | Only classes in the same package/module/assembly             |

**Notes:**

- **Java** uses `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default/package-private (no modifier).
- **C#** uses `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, `protected internal`, and `private protected`.
- **Python** has no enforced visibility, but uses naming conventions: `_name` (protected-like), `__name` (private-like by name mangling). All are technically accessible.

- **public:** Like a car available on a ride-share platform - any authorized person can use it.
- **private:** Like a privately owned car; only the owner (the class itself) can use it.
- **protected:** Like a family vehicle; the owner and their children (subclasses) can use it.
- **default/internal:** Like a company vehicle used by employees within the same office (package/module/assembly).
