## **Definition:**

- Message passing is the process by which objects communicate with each other in OOP by sending and receiving *messages*.
- A message is essentially a request to invoke a method or behavior on an object.
- Instead of directly manipulating an object’s internal data, one object sends a message asking another object to perform a certain action or return information.
- The receiving object then decides **how** to respond to that message internally — encapsulating its implementation details.

## Working

1. **Sender Object** sends a message to a **Receiver Object** — for example, calling a method:
    `javaobjectB.drive();`
    Here, `drive` is the message being sent.
        
2. **Receiver Object** processes the message by executing the method, managing its own internal state as needed.
3. **Sender Object** does **not** need to know the internal structure or state of the receiver; it only knows the interface (what messages the receiver can respond to).

## Advantages

- **Encapsulation:**
    - Objects hide their internal details and expose functionality only through well-defined messages (methods).
    - This protects object state and enforces abstraction.
- **Decoupling:**
    - Sender and receiver are loosely coupled because they interact only via messages, not direct manipulation of internal data.
- **Polymorphism:**
    - Different object types can respond uniquely to the same message. For example, multiple classes might implement a `drive()` method differently.
- **Reuse and Maintainability:**
    - Systems built with message passing are easier to extend and maintain, because internal changes in one object won’t affect others as long as the message interface stays the same.

## Example in Java

```java
class Car {
    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

class Driver {
    void startDriving(Car car) {
        car.drive(); *// Driver sends "drive" message to Car*
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        Driver driver = new Driver();
        driver.startDriving(myCar); *// message passing happening here*
    }
}
```

- The `Driver` sends the `drive` message to the `Car`.
- `Car` decides how to respond.
- `Driver` does not need to know the internals of `Car`.

## Message Passing vs. Method Calling

- At runtime, what looks like method calling (e.g., `object.method()`) in many languages is conceptually message passing: the method call is a message sent to the object.
- The difference is that in message passing, the focus is on *requests for behavior* (messages), not direct access to data or explicit function calls.

## Relation to Cohesion and Coupling

- **Message passing encourages high cohesion** by letting objects handle their own responsibilities (responding to messages appropriately).
- It helps maintain **low coupling** because objects communicate through defined interfaces (messages) rather than tightly binding to each other’s internal details.
