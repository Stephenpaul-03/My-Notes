## **Definition**

- Admission control in computer networks is a process that decides whether to accept or reject new connection requests or traffic flows based on the availability of network resources and the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of those requests.
- Its primary goal is to prevent network congestion and ensure that the network operates within its capacity, maintaining stable performance and QoS for all users.

## **Types**

## **# **In Congestion Control:****

- Admission control is a technique used in virtual-circuit and other networks to avoid congestion by checking if sufficient resources (such as bandwidth) are available before allowing a new traffic flow or virtual circuit to be established.
- If resources are insufficient, the new connection is denied or deferred to keep the network stable and congestion-free
## **# **In Access Control:****

- Admission control is synonymous with network admission control, where it governs whether a device or user can access a network based on compliance with security policies, device health (such as updated antivirus), user identity, and other criteria.
- Only authorized and compliant devices are admitted, which improves network security and compliance with organizational policies and regulations
