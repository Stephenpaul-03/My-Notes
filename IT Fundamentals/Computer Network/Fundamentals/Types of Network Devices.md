## **Types of Network Devices**

- Network hardware refers to the **physical devices required for communication and data transfer** within a network. These devices facilitate routing, switching, data transmission, and connectivity among nodes in both wired and wireless environments.

## **# 1. Network Interface Card (NIC)**

- **Definition:** A hardware component that allows a computer or device to connect to a network.
- **Types:**
    - Wired NIC (Ethernet-based)
    - Wireless NIC (Wi-Fi based)
- **Function:**
    - Encodes/decodes data for transmission.
    - Handles MAC addressing.
- **Advantages:**
    - Enables device-level network access.
    - Modern NICs support high-speed transmission (up to 10 Gbps+).
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Limited by hardware speed and bus architecture (PCIe, USB, etc.).
## **# 2. Switch **

- **Definition:** A multi-port network device that connects multiple devices in a LAN and operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.
- **Function:**
    - Forwards data only to the specific device MAC address.
    - Maintains a MAC address table (CAM table).
- **Advantages:**
    - Reduces network collisions.
    - Improves overall LAN performance.
    - Supports full-duplex transmission.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Does not handle traffic between different networks.
    - Can become a bottleneck without proper configuration.
## **# 3. Router**

- **Definition:** A Layer 3 (Network Layer) device that connects different networks together and routes packets based on IP addresses.
- **Function:**
    - Determines optimal path for data packets.
    - Enables internet connectivity.
    - Performs NAT (Network Address Translation).
- **Advantages:**
    - Supports multiple routing protocols (OSPF, BGP, RIP).
    - Provides firewall and DHCP functionalities.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - More expensive and complex than switches.
    - May require configuration for advanced features.
## **# 4. Hub**

- **Definition:** A basic, outdated networking device that broadcasts incoming data to all connected devices.
- **Function:**
    - Operates at Layer 1 (Physical Layer).
    - Acts as a central connection point in a LAN.
- **Advantages:**
    - Inexpensive and simple to use.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Causes network collisions.
    - Inefficient bandwidth usage due to data flooding.
    - Largely replaced by switches.
## **# 5. Modem**

- **Definition:** A device that modulates and demodulates analog signals to enable digital data transmission over telephone or cable lines.
- **Function:**
    - Converts digital signals from computers to analog for transmission (and vice versa).
    - Enables WAN and internet access.
- **Advantages:**
    - Bridges legacy systems with digital networks.
    - Essential for DSL, cable, and fiber connections.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Not sufficient for internal LAN connectivity.
    - Requires ISP configuration.
## **# 6. Access Point (AP)**

- **Definition:** A device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi.
- **Function:**
    - Acts as a bridge between wireless and wired devices.
    - Extends WLAN coverage.
- **Advantages:**
    - Enables mobile connectivity.
    - Supports multiple devices simultaneously.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Limited range and bandwidth.
    - Requires proper placement to avoid dead zones.
## **# 7. Repeater**

![image.png](image%206.png)

- **Definition:** A device that amplifies or regenerates signals to extend network range.
- **Function:**
    - Receives weak signal and retransmits it at original strength.
    - Used in both wired and wireless networks.
- **Advantages:**
    - Extends network distance without degradation.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Can introduce latency.
    - Does not filter or manage traffic.
## **# 8. Bridge**

![image.png](image%207.png)

- **Definition:** A Layer 2 device used to divide a large network into smaller segments or to connect two LANs.
- **Function:**
    - Filters traffic based on MAC addresses.
    - Reduces collisions in network segments.
- **Advantages:**
    - Enhances performance in segmented networks.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - Limited scalability.
    - Replaced by modern switches in most environments.
## **# 9. Gateway**

![image.png](image%208.png)

- **Definition:** A device that connects networks using different protocols, operating at any OSI layer depending on function.
- **Function:**
    - Converts data formats, protocols, or addresses.
    - Serves as an entry/exit point between networks (e.g., LAN to Internet).
- **Advantages:**
    - Enables cross-platform and cross-network communication.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - High processing load.
    - More complex configuration.
