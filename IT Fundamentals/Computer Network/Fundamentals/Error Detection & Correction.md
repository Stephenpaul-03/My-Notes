## **# a) Error Detection Techniques**

- **Parity Bit**
    - **Working**
        - A single **bit is added** to the data to make the **number of 1s either even (even parity)** or **odd (odd parity)**.
        - At the receiver, the parity is recalculated. If it doesn’t match, an error is detected.
    - **Advantage**
        - Very simple and low overhead.
    - **Disadvantage**
        - Can only detect **single-bit errors**; fails with **even-numbered bit errors**.
- **Checksum**
    - **Working**
        - Data is divided into equal segments (e.g., 16-bit words).
        - All segments are **added together**, and the sum is appended to the packet.
        - The receiver **recomputes the checksum** and compares it with the received one.
    - **Advantage**
        - Detects most common errors.
    - Disadvantge
        - Vulnerable to **bit order changes** or **cancelling errors**.
- **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**
    - **Working**
        - Treats the entire data block as a **binary polynomial**.
        - Divides it by a predefined **generator polynomial** using modulo-2 division.
        - Appends the **remainder (CRC bits)** to the data.
        - Receiver divides received block with the same polynomial — if remainder is non-zero, an error is detected.
    - **Advantage**
        - **Highly accurate**, used in Ethernet, disk storage, etc.
    - **Disadvantage**
        - Cannot correct errors, only detect.

## **# b) Error Correction Techniques**

- **Hamming Code**
    - **Working**
        - Adds **multiple parity bits** at positions based on powers of 2.
        - Each parity bit covers specific positions.
        - On error, the receiver calculates the **syndrome** (error location).
        - Single-bit error is **identified and corrected automatically**.
    - **Advantage**
        - Corrects **single-bit errors** and detects **two-bit errors**.
    - **Disadvantage**
        - Overhead increases with message length.
- **Reed-Solomon**
    - **Working**
        - Encodes data as a polynomial over a finite field.
        - Adds **redundant data** so that a certain number of errors can be corrected.
        - Decoding uses **algebraic techniques** to correct multiple errors.
    - **Advantages**
        - Corrects **burst errors**.
        - Used in **CDs, DVDs, QR codes, satellite communication**.
    - **Disadvantages**
        - **Computationally intensive** and complex.
- **Forward Error Correction (FEC)**
    - **Working**
        - Sender encodes data with redundancy bits using **error-correcting code**.
        - Receiver can **correct errors without retransmission**.
    - **Advantage**
        - **No need for acknowledgment** or retransmission (ideal for real-time systems).
    - **Disadvantage**
        - Higher bandwidth usage due to redundancy.
